Input the quantity of the product being sold.
Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all products being sold.
When finished inputting products, enter "exit" to calculate the total cost of the transaction.
Notes
The system reads the product information from a text file (products.txt) in the following format: itemCode,productName,productPrice
The system outputs the transaction information to the console.
The system uses a Product class to represent each product, and a Transaction class to represent the transaction as a whole.
The system uses the javax package for user input and output.
