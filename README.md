**Point of Sale System**

This is a Java project that implements a Point of Sale (POS) system using the `javax` package. The system allows a user to input the products being sold and calculate the total cost of the transaction.

**Requirements:**

- Java SE Development Kit 8 or higher
- Eclipse IDE (or any Java IDE of your choice)

**Installation:**

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Import the project into Eclipse.
3. Build the project.
4. Run the `NewJFrame.java` file.

**Usage:**

1. Input the item code of the product being sold.
2. Input the quantity of the product being sold.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all products being sold.
4. When finished inputting products, enter "exit" to calculate the total cost of the transaction.

   Note: The system reads the product information from a text file (`products.txt`) in the following format: `itemCode,productName,productPrice`

5. The system outputs the transaction information to the console.

**Notes:**

- The system uses a `Product` class to represent each product, and a `Transaction` class to represent the transaction as a whole.
- The system uses the `javax` package for user input and output.
