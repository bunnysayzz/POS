**Point of Sale System**
This is a Java project that implements a Point of Sale (POS) system using the javax package. The system allows a user to input the products being sold and calculate the total cost of the transaction.

**Requirements:**
Java SE Development Kit 8 or higher
Eclipse IDE (or any Java IDE of your choice)


**Installation:**
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Import the project into Eclipse.
Build the project.
Run the NewJFrame.java file.

**Usage:**
Input the item code of the product being sold.
Input the quantity of the product being sold.
Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all products being sold.
When finished inputting products, enter "exit" to calculate the total cost of the transaction.

**Notes:**
The system reads the product information from a text file (products.txt) in the following format: itemCode,productName,productPrice
The system outputs the transaction information to the console.
The system uses a Product class to represent each product, and a Transaction class to represent the transaction as a whole.
The system uses the javax package for user input and output.
